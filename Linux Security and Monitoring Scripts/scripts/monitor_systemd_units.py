"""
Short summary:
Monitor systemd unit files to find ones that are used for malware persistence.

NOTE: The first execution of this script should be done with the argument "--init".
Otherwise, the script will only show you the current state of the environment since no state was established yet.
However, this assumes that the system is uncompromised during the initial execution.
Hence, if you are unsure this is the case you should verify the current state
before monitoring for changes will become an effective security measure.

Requirements:
None

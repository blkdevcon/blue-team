# Tools of the Trade 

If you have any issues with a tool here, or have questions about usage, or really anything, please reach out and I will be glad to help.

The tools here are broad in function but have many uses in the Triage/Threat Hunting/Incident Response fields.  Be careful and do your own research with PEs you find on the internet!

Tools like Seatbelt can be compiled directly from their source code, while triage-ir-v1 cannot.  I have determined that these tools are safe, but again, do your own research!

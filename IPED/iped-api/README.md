# IPED-API

This module aims to define an API for IPED software. Currently most interfaces
were generated automatically from implementation classes of other modules. Most 
interfaces are still not documented or are still in portuguese.

Interfaces will be refactored for 4.0 version of the software, breaking back compatibility with
3.x versions.

Lots of work to be done...

License
The viewer is not Open Source, but the usage of the viewer is free of any charge. You may download it and use it at your own risk. Although doing my best to make it a useful tool there is no guarantee for this.

3rd Party Code
The viewer uses a few Open Source libraries. They run under the following licenses.

Apache 2.0 License
For unpacking files packed with bzip2 code from the Apache Ant project extracted by Kohsuke Kawaguchi is used. For displaying WMF (Windows Meta File) data code extracted from the Apache Batik project is used. Both are provided under the Apache 2.0 License. Thanks a lot!

Public Domain Code
For displaying files dragged on the viewer FileDrop by Robert Harder is used. It’s in the public domain. Thank you, Robert!

Others
For displaying balloon tool tips the BalloonTip library by Bernhard Pauler and Tim Molderez is used. It is provided under the following license:
